# A/B Test Executive Decision Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes the business impact of a **10% discount experiment** using A/B testing methodology.  
The goal is to determine whether the discount increases **revenue per user (RPU)** and if the result is **statistically significant** enough to support a full rollout.

## Key Results
- **RPU uplift:** +1.9% vs. control  
- **p-value:** < 0.001 (statistically significant)  
- **95% confidence interval:** +0.77% to +2.99%  
- Entire confidence interval lies **above zero**, confirming a **positive and reliable revenue impact**

## Executive Decision
**Rollout Recommended — Revenue Impact Positive**

The statistical evidence shows the 10% discount meaningfully increases revenue per user with strong confidence, supporting production deployment.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- End-to-end **A/B test analysis**
- **Hypothesis testing, p-value, and confidence interval interpretation**
- Translation of **statistical results into business decisions**
